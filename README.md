# rubiks

My plan is to create an app which can:
1. use computer vision to turn a real rubiks cube configuration into python encoding of the cube
2. use reinforcement learning to suggest a solution (or partial solutions) to the user

So far, I have build the data structure for the cube, a rendering of the net of the cube, and also functions for turning each face of the cube
